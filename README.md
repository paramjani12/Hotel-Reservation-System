# Hotel Reservation System


### **Project Description**

A Hotel Reservation System having scheduling calendar component and room statuses bar. System has three components. First component has list of all rooms and their types and icons. Second component is scheduler where guest details will appear on check-in. Third component has all rooms’ status information. Major features are guest check-in and assigning services. Guest check-in leads to reservation of room according to check-in check-out dates and room numbers with key details like guest name, their stay information, payment details in form of a slot (div) in the scheduler. The admin can add, edit or move slots according to the need. Another feature is assigning services.
